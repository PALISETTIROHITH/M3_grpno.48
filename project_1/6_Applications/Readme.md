## APPLICATIONS OF RKE:

Remote keyless entry systems, now fairly commonplace devices, provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessary. A passive keyless entry (PKE) system uses advanced technology to take vehicle accessibility to a higher level.  
With PKE, car owners have simply to pull the door handle while the key fob is on their person; no searching through pockets or purses, no button pressing necessary.
